    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fettuccine Alfredo is an Italian pasta dish of fresh fettuccine
    tossed with butter and Parmesan.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb Fettuccine Pasta</li>
        <li>6 Tablespoons Butter</li>
        <li>1 Garlic Clove (minced)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup Shredded Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Italian Parsley (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. Add salt to season the water. Once it is boiling, add fettuccine and cook according to package instructions. </li>
        <li>In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream. </li>
        <li>Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat and whisk well until cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.</li>
        <li>Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.</li>
        <li>Garnish with Italian parsley, if so desired.</li>
    </ol>
